# Assignment1a-Pokemon-Object

Create a simple Pokemon object class. We are going to use this most of the semester so make a good start!

There will be 7 instance variables
  * String name
  * String nickName
  * int number
  * String type1
  * String type2
  * int HP
  * int CP
  
These variables represent the fields that are stored in the Pokemon Go game. name will be used for the "official" name, like Bulbasaur or Pikachu. The nickName is for a user-defined name. The number will be the official Pokemon number out of the Pokedex. The types will be Pokemon types like water, fire, flying, etc. HP is the "hit points" and CP is the "combat power"

There should be two constructors.
 1. Takes in 5 parameters: name, nickName, number, type1, type2
 2. Takes in 4 parameters: name, number, type1, type2
  * This constructor should set the nickName to the same as the name
